Not only as a data scientist but also for lots of major no one can deny the importance of statistic. I always liked mathematic, I remember when I was at high school by watching two movies by chance, I fall in love with probability theory. The first movie was "Blind chance" by ‎Krzysztof Kieślowski, and the second one " The game" by   David Fincher. During the university time I red "A first course in Probability" by   Sheldon M. Ross and it was start of my journey. Here I try to share and collect all interesting things from everywhere I red them.
Usually we use descriptive statistic a lot in the EDA. If you want to have a good felling when you start to attack a data science problem, it is a good idea to study and review those part of statistic. In this diary(notebook) I will  try to give some example.
