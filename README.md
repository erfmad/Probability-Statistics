Not only as a data scientist but also for lots of major no one can deny the importance of statistic. I always liked mathematic, I remember when I was at high school by watching two movies by chance, I fall in love with probability theory. The first movie was "Blind chance" by ‎Krzysztof Kieślowski, and the second one " The game" by   David Fincher. During the university time I red "A first course in Probability" by   Sheldon M. Ross and it was start of my journey. Here I try to share and collect all interesting things from everywhere I red them.
